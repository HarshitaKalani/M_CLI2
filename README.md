## Name
### M_CLI2 - parse Unix-like command line arguments from Fortran

## Description
   M_CLI2(3f) is a Fortran module that will crack the command line when
   given a prototype string that looks very much like an invocation of
   the program. A call to get_args(3f) or one of its variants is then
   made for each parameter name to set the variables appropriately in
   the program.

## Example Program
This short program defines a command that can be called like

```bash
   ./show -x 10 -y -20 -p 10,20,30 --title 'plot of stuff' -L
   # these parameters are defined automatically 
   ./show --usage 
   ./show --help
   ./show --version
   # you must supply text for "help" and "version" if desired.
```
```fortran
   program show
   use M_CLI2, only : set_args, lget, rget, sget, igets
   implicit none
   real                          :: sum
   integer,allocatable           :: p(:)
   character(len=:),allocatable  :: title
   logical                       :: l, lbig
      !
      ! Define command and default values and parse supplied command line options
      !
      call set_args('-x 1 -y 2.0 -z 3.5e0 -p 11,-22,33 --title "my title" -l F -L F')
      !
      ! Get values using convenience functions
      !
      sum=rget('x') + rget('y') + rget('z')
      title=sget('title')
      p=igets('p')
      l=lget('l')
      lbig=lget('L')
      !
      ! All ready to go
      !
      write(*,*)sum,l,lbig,p,title
   end program show
```
An arbitrary number of strings such as filenames may be passed in on
the end of commands, you can query whether an option was supplied, and
get_args(3f)-related routines can be used for refining options such as
requiring lists of a specified size. Passing in some character arrays
allows you to automatically have a --help and --version switch as well,
as explained using the examples below.

## Demo Programs![demos](docs/images/demo.gif)
These demo programs provide templates for the most common usage:

* [demo1B](example/demo1.f90)  basic with help and version, using the convenience functions
* [demo1](example/demo1.f90)   using the convenience functions
* [demo2](example/demo2.f90)   putting everything including **help** and **version** information into a contained procedure.
* [demo3](example/demo3.f90)   example of **basic** use
* [demo4](example/demo4.f90)   _COMPLEX_ type values
* [demo5](example/demo5.f90)   _CHARACTER_ type values
* [demo6](example/demo6.f90)   a complicated example showing how to create a command with subcommands
* [demo7](example/demo7.f90)   controlling array delimiter characters
* [demo8](example/demo8.f90)   multiple keyword and variable pairs on get_args(3f) for limited cases
* [demo9](example/demo9.f90)   long and short names using  --LONGNAME:SHORTNAME
* [demo10](example/demo10.f90) full usage and even equivalencing

## Download and Build with Make(1)![gmake](docs/images/gnu.gif)
   Compile the M_CLI2 module and build all the example programs.
```bash
       git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2.git
       cd M_CLI2/src
       # change Makefile if not using one of the listed compilers
     
       # for gfortran
       make clean
       make gfortran
     
       # for ifort
       make clean
       make ifort

       # for nvfortran
       make clean
       make nvfortran

       # display other options (test, run, doxygen, ford, ...)
       make help 
```
   To install you then generally copy the *.mod file and *.a file to
   an appropriate directory.  Unfortunately, the specifics vary but in
   general if you have a directory $HOME/.local/lib and copy those files
   there then you can generally enter something like
```bash
     gfortran -L$HOME/.local/lib -lM_CLI2  myprogram.f90 -o myprogram
```
   There are different methods for adding the directory to your default
   load path, but frequently you can append the directory you have
   placed the files in into the colon-separated list of directories
   in the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH or $LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, and
   then the -L option will not be required (or it's equivalent in your
   programming environment).
```bash
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
   **NOTE**: If you use multiple Fortran compilers you may need to create
   a different directory for each compiler. I would recommend it, such
   as $HOME/.local/lib/gfortran/.

   If you desire a shared library as well, for gfortran you may enter
```bash
     make clean gfortran gfortran_install
```
   and everything needed by gfortran will be placed in libgfortran/ that
   you may add to an appropriate area, such as $HOME/.local/lib/gfortran/.
```bash
     make clean ifort ifort_install # same for ifort
```

   NOTE: These instructions are specific to a ULS (Unix-Like System) and 
   may differ, especially for those wishing to generate shared libraries
   which varies significantly from compiler to compiler. For some builds
   it is simpler to make a Makefile for each compiler, which might be
   required for a more comprehensive build unless you are very familiar
   with gmake(1).

   If you always use one compiler it is relatively simple, otherwise
   make sure you know what your system requires and change the Makefile
   as appropriate.

## Supports FPM ![parse](docs/images/fpm_logo.gif) 
   Alternatively, fpm(1) users may download the github repository and build it with
   fpm ( as described at [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) )
```bash
        git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2.git
        cd M_CLI2
        fpm test   # build and test the module
	fpm install # install the module (in the default location)
```
   or just list it as a dependency in your fpm.toml project file.
```toml
        [dependencies]
        M_CLI2        = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2.git" }
```
## Functional Specification
**This is how the interface works --**

* Pass in a string to set_args(3f) that looks almost like the command
  you would use to execute the program except with all keywords and
  default values specified.

* you add calls to the get_args(3f) procedure or one of its variants (
  The alternatives allow you to use a simple function-based interface
  model. There are special routines for when you want to use fixed length.
  CHARACTER variables or fixed-size arrays instead of the allocatable
  variables best used with get_args(3f)).

  Now when you call the program all the values in the prototype should
  be updated using values from the command line and queried and ready
  to use in your program.

## Response files
[Response files](response.md) are supported as described in the documentation for
[set_args](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_CLI2/set_args.3m_cli2.html).
They are a system-independent way to create short abbreviations for long
complex commands. This option is generally not needed by programs with
just a few options, but can be particularly useful for programs with
dozens of options where various values are frequently reused.
